Dating apps require us to entrust them with our locations, personal photos, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, dating intentions, vices, as well as the messages we send to matches. Apps that fail to overcome our concerns about sharing information never gain traction, so evolution favors apps that make us feel most safe. Yet feeling safe and being safe are very different things.

Consider the very real possibility that all of the information you share with an app – your profile, your likes and dislikes, and the messages you share with others – might all be stolen in a data breach. The servers on which these apps store their data are effectively central repositories the sexual preferences and messages of millions upon millions of individuals, making them ripe targets for compromise by foreign intelligence services and other extortionists. Most dating apps are ill-prepared to fight such formidable adversaries, having been built as scrappy startups, with threadbare security teams, and tasked with rapid innovation at all costs to beat the rapidly-innovating competition. Tinder, which launched in 2012, didn't even implement the rudimentary step of encrypting the photos sent to the app from its servers until [2018](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/29/17519234/tinder-encrypted-profile-photos-senator-ron-wyden) (after it was merged into the more-mature Match Group). The breaches we know about, like the very-public 2015 breach of [Ashley Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Madison_data_breach), are likely a small minority, because most attackers work hard to keep their breaches from being discovered; foreign intelligence agencies want to be able to collect fresh data on an ongoing basis.

Yet, considering the possibility of a breach when deciding what to share is not among the safety advice offered by [Tinder](https://policies.tinder.com/safety/intl/en/), [Bumble](https://bumble.com/en-us/the-buzz/safety), [Hinge](https://hingeapp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007194774-Safe-Dating-Advice)
, [Grindr](https://help.grindr.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500009290262-Safety-tips), and [Feeld](https://support.feeld.co/hc/en-gb/articles/9406785773084-What-do-I-do-if-someone-asks-me-to-continue-the-conversation-in-a-different-app-). The possibility of a breach isn't even mentioned.

Dating apps also aren't engineered to protect your actions and messages in the event their servers are breached.


In fact, dating apps exploit your safety concerns to discourage you from moving your conversations from their apps to messaging apps engineered to protect your privacy using end-to-end encryption, such as WhatsApp and Signal[^phone-number]. One reason to keep you on app is so that they can eavesdrop on your conversations for evidence that the other party is trying to scam you, but they fail to disclose that their architecture makes it more likely that they won't be the only ones able to eavesdrop.

[^phone-number]: Further, apps like WhatsApp and Signal require you to give your messaging partner your phone number, which they may be able to use to unearth all sorts of information about you. Skype [doesn't require a phone number](https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34942/how-are-my-contact-details-used-in-skype) but [requires extra work to turn on end-to-end encryption](https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34824/what-are-skype-private-conversations).


Yet, the actions taken by dating apps indicate you shouldn't trust them, because their products not designed to protect against their own failures. Increasingly, applications with high security requirements have adopted architectures designed to reduce trust you need to place on their platform. Messengers like iMessage, WhatsApp, and Signal use end-to-end encryption to protect your data before it is sent to their servers, so that even they cannot read your messages from that data. Password managers also use end-to-end encryption to store your passwords so that even they don't have access to them without your master password. Dating apps, on the other hand, record nearly every action you take and every message you send other users.[^dating-app-records]

[^dating-app-records]: See, for example, what journalist Judith Duportail learned from requesting [the information Tinder kept](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/26/tinder-personal-data-dating-app-messages-hacked-sold) on her.

Yet, these apps were mostly created by once-scrappy startups, built by threadbare security teams, constantly innovating to stay ahead of the competition and win our attention. Tinder, which launched in 2012, didn't even encrypt the photos it sent to your app from its servers until [2018](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/29/17519234/tinder-encrypted-profile-photos-senator-ron-wyden), a year after it was merged into the Match Group.

These security teams are ill-equipped to face off against well-funded nation states, but they have to, because dating apps know a lot about our sexual needs and secrets and intelligence agencies unearthing and exploiting the sexual needs and secrets of potential assets is Intelligence 101.  Dating apps are a goldmine of this information. Given that intelligence services have breached Microsoft and Google, with their massive and innovative security teams, it would be surprising if foreign intelligence didn't have access to the data stored by Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge (the top 3 apps), as well as Grindr and Feeld (beloved by those less normative sexual interests that may be easier to exploit).





Apps that fail to make users safe sharing this information and exchanging messages with other users never get off the ground.

A market in which every player must know they are vulnerable, but confidently presents themselves as secure, knowingly ignoring their potential vulnerabilities, might be said to suffer from *toxic appulinity*.


Thus, when you read the information dating apps share about safe use, you won't see any mention that they might fail to protect your data when 

 dating apps talk about safety, they don't even mention the possibility that their apps might fail to properly protect this data.

When dating apps talk about safety, they don't discuss how safely they protect your data because they don't want you to even think about the possibility that they might be vulnerable---it's hard to show your vulnerable side when the competition presents themselves as secure and confident. So, 


[Feeld (partial)](https://support.feeld.co/hc/en-gb/articles/9406785773084-What-do-I-do-if-someone-asks-me-to-continue-the-conversation-in-a-different-app-)

Few relationships have stood the test of time as long as that human sexuality and international espionage. Unearthing and exploiting the sexual needs and secrets of potential assets is Intelligence 101. When we jump into dating apps, we entrust them with details of our sexual preferences and desires. Most are formerly-scrappy startups, built by threadbare security teams, constantly innovating to stay ahead of the competition and win our attention. It's hard for companies to truly prioritize security when pressured to grow and innovate in a hyper-competitive marketplace.

It would be surprising if the intelligence services of Russia and China were not investing heavily to compromise dating apps, likely with more resources than are available to defend them. Their heads of intelligence deserve to be fired if they have yet to find ways to get at the data guarded by Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge (the top 3 apps), as well as Grindr and Feeld (beloved by those less normative sexual interests that may be easier to exploit).

Whereas the massive security teams at companies like Microsoft advertise that their products are engineered under the assumption that nation states will breach them (“[assume breach](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/zero-trust)”), dating apps don’t. Admittedly, it’s hard to show your vulnerable side when competing dating apps present themselves as secure and confident. The challenge of helping prospective users overcome their anxiety of signing up is hard enough without ensuring they are aware that their every action may be witnessed by their nation’s adversaries.

Your dating profile may be stored and made public at any time in the future

Your private messages are note entirely private.

Every action is being recorded. Most people’s swiping on apps like Tinder and Bumble is likely indicative of implicit biases some of which may be comfortable to have exposed (age) and some of which may not be (race, income, occupation, religion). If you expect to be in a position where you will claim that you view others as equals regardless of their race, occupation, religion, or other factors, expect that some day data proving that you have at least implicit biases in selecting matches based on their race, income, occupation, religion, sexual preferences, disability status, BMI, or other aesthetic/demographic features discernible from dating app profiles.

Espionage and sex are
