### Step 1: Assume the dating app has been breached by foreign intelligence services

If you’re looking for an example of a longterm relationship that keeps going strong, look no further than the one between sex and international espionage. Unearthing and exploiting the sexual needs and secrets of potential assets is Intelligence 101. The ubiquity of dating apps has placed so many of our sexual preferences and history into the databases of scrappy startups, and formerly-scrappy startups, built by threadbare security teams. It thus seems reasonable to assume that the intelligence services of Russia and China surely have more assets focused on compromising dating apps than those apps have protecting themselves. Their heads of intelligence deserve to be fired if they have yet to find ways to get at the data guarded by Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge (the top 3 apps), as well as Grindr and Feeld (beloved by those less normative sexual interests that may be easier to exploit).

Whereas the massive security teams at companies like Microsoft advertise that their products are engineered under the assumption that nation states will breach them (“[assume breach](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/zero-trust)”), dating apps don’t. Admittedly, it’s hard to show your vulnerable side when competing dating apps present themselves as secure and confident. The challenge of helping prospective users overcome their anxiety of signing up is hard enough without ensuring they are aware that their every action may be witnessed by their nation’s adversaries.

Your dating profile may be stored and made public at any time in the future

Your private messages are note entirely private.

Most people’s swiping on apps like Tinder and Bumble is likely indicative of implicit biases some of which may be comfortable to have exposed (age) and some of which may not be (race, income, occupation, religion). If you expect to be in a position where you will claim that you view others as equals regardless of their race, occupation, religion, or other factors, expect that some day data proving that you have at least implicit biases in selecting matches based on their race, income, occupation, religion, sexual preferences, disability status, BMI, or other aesthetic/demographic features discernible from dating app profiles.
