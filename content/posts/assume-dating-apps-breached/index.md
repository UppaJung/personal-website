### Step 1: Assume the dating app has been breached by foreign intelligence services

If you're looking for a relationship that stands the test of time, there are few better examples to look to than the relation between human sexuality and international espionage. Unearthing and exploiting the sexual needs and secrets of potential assets is Intelligence 101. When we jump into dating apps, we entrust them with details of our sexual preferences and desires. Most are formerly-scrappy startups, built by threadbare security teams, constantly innovating to stay ahead of the competition and win our attention. It's hard for companies to truly prioritize security when pressured to grow and innovate in a hyper-competitive marketplace.

It would be surprising if the intelligence services of Russia and China were not investing heavily to compromise dating apps, likely with more resources than are available to defend them. Their heads of intelligence deserve to be fired if they have yet to find ways to get at the data guarded by Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge (the top 3 apps), as well as Grindr and Feeld (beloved by those less normative sexual interests that may be easier to exploit).

Whereas the massive security teams at companies like Microsoft advertise that their products are engineered under the assumption that nation states will breach them (“[assume breach](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/zero-trust)”), dating apps don’t. Admittedly, it’s hard to show your vulnerable side when competing dating apps present themselves as secure and confident. The challenge of helping prospective users overcome their anxiety of signing up is hard enough without ensuring they are aware that their every action may be witnessed by their nation’s adversaries.

Your dating profile may be stored and made public at any time in the future

Your private messages are note entirely private.

Every action is being recorded. Most people’s swiping on apps like Tinder and Bumble is likely indicative of implicit biases some of which may be comfortable to have exposed (age) and some of which may not be (race, income, occupation, religion). If you expect to be in a position where you will claim that you view others as equals regardless of their race, occupation, religion, or other factors, expect that some day data proving that you have at least implicit biases in selecting matches based on their race, income, occupation, religion, sexual preferences, disability status, BMI, or other aesthetic/demographic features discernible from dating app profiles.
