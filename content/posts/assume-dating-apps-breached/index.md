<!-- ### Step 1: Assume the dating app has been breached by foreign intelligence services -->
<!-- To succeed, dating apps must make you, and all their other users, feel safe entrusting them with your location, personal photos, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, dating intentions, and vices. 

Yet, the ways they discuss your safety and design their products should raise a red flag.
 -->

To use dating apps we must entrust them with our locations, personal photos, physical traits, ages, chemical vices, sexual desires, religious beliefs, and the messages we exchange with prospective sexual partners. Evolution favors those apps that can convince the greatest fraction of prospective users to trust them.

If you're considering using dating apps you should understand that keeping you safe and making you feel safe are two distinct, and sometimes incompatible, goals. When you read the safety tips offered by the likes of [Tinder](https://policies.tinder.com/safety/intl/en/) [📄](dating-tips-archived-2023-08-10/tinder.jpeg), [Bumble](https://bumble.com/en-us/the-buzz/safety) [📄](dating-tips-archived-2023-08-10/bumble.jpeg), [Hinge](https://hingeapp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007194774-Safe-Dating-Advice) [📄](dating-tips-archived-2023-08-10/hinge.jpeg), [Grindr](https://help.grindr.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500009290262-Safety-tips) [📄](dating-tips-archived-2023-08-10/grindr.jpeg), and [Feeld](https://support.feeld.co/hc/en-gb/articles/9406785773084-What-do-I-do-if-someone-asks-me-to-continue-the-conversation-in-a-different-app-) [📄](dating-tips-archived-2023-08-10/feeld.jpeg), you should note that these tips focus heavily on the risks inherent to communicating online and dating people in general, and not the additional risks you take on when you sing up for a dating app.[^safety-tips-bumble] For example, the safety tips on Tinder and Hinge (both owned by Match Group) is divided into three categories: Online Safety, which (aside from picking a password) is about interacting safely with other users online, safety when 'Meeting in Person', and 'Sexual Health' (sexual safety).

Foremost is the risk that all the information you share with their apps – your profile, your likes and dislikes, and the messages you share with others – could be stolen if there is a breach of their. These servers store the data of all of an app's users, making them ripe targets for compromise by foreign intelligence services, ransomware gangs, and other extortionists who might exploit our sexual desires, preferences, and communications.

Most dating were built by scrappy startups with threadbare security teams, forbidden from slowing the rapid innovation required in a hyper-competitive environment. They are ill-matched against well-resourced intelligence agencies and criminal gangs funded by nation states.[^security-priorities-at-tinder] These adversaries work hard to remain undetected so that they can continuously collect fresh data on new targets. It stands to reason that we only know about a small minority of actual breaches. It's surprising, for example, that those who breached [Ashley Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Madison_data_breach) announced their success and released all the data as evidence, especially since their users' data would have been especially valuable for extortion if kept private (Ashley Madison was those seeking extramarital affairs).

[^security-priorities-at-tinder]: Consider, for example, that Tinder, which launched in 2012, didn't even implement the rudimentary step of encrypting the photos sent to the app from its servers until [2018](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/29/17519234/tinder-encrypted-profile-photos-senator-ron-wyden) (after it was merged into the more-mature Match Group).

Unlike iMessage, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Signal, Skype, and others, the messaging features in dating apps don't currently give you even the option to protect your communications via end-to-end encryption. End-to-end encryption is an app feature that can keep your messages private even if the servers the app stores them on, and transmits them through, are breached. Without this feature, anyone with access to the app's servers can eavesdrop on, and store, your every message.

Dating apps explain that they need to eavesdrop on your conversations to detect scams and abuse, and discourage you from moving your conversations elsewhere, but they fail to disclose that eavesdropping-by-design puts you at risk and isn't always necessary. They could offer optional end-to-end encryption and give you the option with the app to give them the keys to decrypt a conversation if the other participant started behaving abusively or tried to scam you. They could add code to the app that would examine messages without sending them to the server and alert you to common scams. The top apps don't give you the option to keep them from eavesdropping on your every message, and storing them all, because all the other apps do the same thing. If you want to use a dating app, you have no choice but to accept eavesdropping.

Since all dating apps eavesdrop, the only way to have a private conversation with a match is to move your conversation to a messaging app that offers end-to-end encryption. One reason this is an unfortunate state of affairs is that you will no longer be able to provide the dating app the evidence they need to take action if that match turns out to be abusive or a scammer. Moreover, moving to an end-to-end encrypted app like WhatsApp or Signal will require you to share your phone number[^phone-number], which may be all your match needs to learn your name, address, and everything else that data brokers might have to offer.[^kanary]. If dating app developers truly cared about your safety, they would offer end-to-end encrypted messaging that remained private until either you or your match chose to share it with the app's safety team.

[^phone-number]: Skype [doesn't require a phone number](https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34942/how-are-my-contact-details-used-in-skype) but [requires extra work to turn on end-to-end encryption](https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34824/what-are-skype-private-conversations).

Dating apps also  record nearly every swipe and action you take.[^dating-app-records]

HEREMAN

[^dating-app-records]: See, for example, what journalist Judith Duportail learned from requesting [the information Tinder kept](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/26/tinder-personal-data-dating-app-messages-hacked-sold) on her.

Yet, these apps were mostly created by once-scrappy startups, built by threadbare security teams, constantly innovating to stay ahead of the competition and win our attention. Tinder, which launched in 2012, didn't even encrypt the photos it sent to your app from its servers until [2018](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/29/17519234/tinder-encrypted-profile-photos-senator-ron-wyden), a year after it was merged into the Match Group.

These security teams are ill-equipped to face off against well-funded nation states, but they have to, because dating apps know a lot about our sexual needs and secrets and intelligence agencies unearthing and exploiting the sexual needs and secrets of potential assets is Intelligence 101.  Dating apps are a goldmine of this information. Given that intelligence services have breached Microsoft and Google, with their massive and innovative security teams, it would be surprising if foreign intelligence didn't have access to the data stored by Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge (the top 3 apps), as well as Grindr and Feeld (beloved by those less normative sexual interests that may be easier to exploit).





Apps that fail to make users safe sharing this information and exchanging messages with other users never get off the ground.

A market in which every player must know they are vulnerable, but confidently presents themselves as secure, knowingly ignoring their potential vulnerabilities, might be said to suffer from *toxic appulinity*.


Thus, when you read the information dating apps share about safe use, you won't see any mention that they might fail to protect your data when 

 dating apps talk about safety, they don't even mention the possibility that their apps might fail to properly protect this data.

When dating apps talk about safety, they don't discuss how safely they protect your data because they don't want you to even think about the possibility that they might be vulnerable---it's hard to show your vulnerable side when the competition presents themselves as secure and confident. So, 


[Feeld (partial)](https://support.feeld.co/hc/en-gb/articles/9406785773084-What-do-I-do-if-someone-asks-me-to-continue-the-conversation-in-a-different-app-)

Few relationships have stood the test of time as long as that human sexuality and international espionage. Unearthing and exploiting the sexual needs and secrets of potential assets is Intelligence 101. When we jump into dating apps, we entrust them with details of our sexual preferences and desires. Most are formerly-scrappy startups, built by threadbare security teams, constantly innovating to stay ahead of the competition and win our attention. It's hard for companies to truly prioritize security when pressured to grow and innovate in a hyper-competitive marketplace.

It would be surprising if the intelligence services of Russia and China were not investing heavily to compromise dating apps, likely with more resources than are available to defend them. Their heads of intelligence deserve to be fired if they have yet to find ways to get at the data guarded by Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge (the top 3 apps), as well as Grindr and Feeld (beloved by those less normative sexual interests that may be easier to exploit).

Whereas the massive security teams at companies like Microsoft advertise that their products are engineered under the assumption that nation states will breach them (“[assume breach](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/zero-trust)”), dating apps don’t. Admittedly, it’s hard to show your vulnerable side when competing dating apps present themselves as secure and confident. The challenge of helping prospective users overcome their anxiety of signing up is hard enough without ensuring they are aware that their every action may be witnessed by their nation’s adversaries.

Your dating profile may be stored and made public at any time in the future

Your private messages are note entirely private.

Every action is being recorded. Most people’s swiping on apps like Tinder and Bumble is likely indicative of implicit biases some of which may be comfortable to have exposed (age) and some of which may not be (race, income, occupation, religion). If you expect to be in a position where you will claim that you view others as equals regardless of their race, occupation, religion, or other factors, expect that some day data proving that you have at least implicit biases in selecting matches based on their race, income, occupation, religion, sexual preferences, disability status, BMI, or other aesthetic/demographic features discernible from dating app profiles.

Espionage and sex are 

Articles covering how to use dating apps safely sometimes make the mistake of how to avoid meeting up with someone dangerous. (e.g. https://time.com/6256395/dating-app-safety-tips/), or not sharing information that will allow .  People assume dating apps work as advertised, and that a private messages are really private.





[^safety-tips-bumble]: A notable exception is Bumble's article on [What You Need to Know About Safety on Bumble](https://bumble.com/en-us/the-buzz/safety) [Bumble](https://bumble.com/en-us/the-buzz/safety) [📄](dating-tips-archived-2023-08-10/bumble.jpeg), which does advise caution in deciding how much detail to share in one's profile:
    > We also encourage members of our community to be cautious when deciding what personal information to share in your profile. It’s absolutely fine to list your occupation as “account manager” at “tech company” rather than sharing details. Omitting photos that show you in a specific location you frequent (e.g. your go-to dog park or local bar) is another way to practice safer online dating.
    
    Still, none of their examples suggest not sharing information at all, and they do little to help users explain who will be able to access the information that the user shared or explain why sharing detailed information might be risky.

[^kanary]: Before using a dating app, you may want to consider using a service like [Kanary](https://www.kanary.com/) to search and try to remove information offered by data brokers.
