Getting people's pronouns right is a struggle when attending large events, even when those running and attending the events care about gender inclusivity. When I watch others struggle with pronouns at these events, it's both a relief that I'm not alone and a disappointment that we are *all* so bad at this.

Even in 2023, most events I attend don't even have pronouns on name tags. Even when they do, we can rarely read someone's third-person pronouns off their name tag when we need them—we use those third-person pronouns when speaking about them to others. Even if the person we are speaking about is present, they would not be who we are looking at when we speak.

Attendees normally cope by using gendered pronouns by default and trying to remember the *exceptions*. Unfortunately, the *exceptions* we are likely to use the wrong pronouns for are the historically-marginalized groups we are supposed to be trying to do a better job of including.

Adopting gender-neutral third-party pronouns as the norm would be more inclusive, but I've yet to attend an event that achieved this.

Changing norms requires affordances that make the new norm feel safe. If attendees fear they are more likely to offend by calling someone 'they' than guessing the correct gendered pronoun, they'll keep using gendered pronouns by default.

To make the more inclusive norm safe, we need to update event registrations and name tags to:
1. include pronouns on name tags and other materials *by default*
2. encourage attendees to welcome gender-neutral pronouns *by default*
3. allow attendees to opt out of these defaults (so nobody need object)

The following sample registration and name tag illustrate one way to do this. Try it yourself!

<link rel="stylesheet" href="./registration-form.css">
<div data-registration-form-here="true" class="registration-and-name-tag-container"></div>
<script src="./registration-pronouns.js"></script>

Observe that this design differentiates pronouns that attendees *prefer* from those they merely *welcome*. This design establishes a norm of accepting gender-neutral *they* pronouns (they should welcome them) even when one prefers a gendered pronoun.

This design addresses our cognitive limits by exceptions to the norm easy to spot: all exceptions end with a boldface '**only**'. You can safely use 'they' pronouns for everyone else, and the exception cases are less likely to be members of marginalized populations. Using preferred pronouns becomes less of a cognitive necessity, and more of a signal of familiarity or intimacy that you can arrive at your own pace.

The nudge towards inclusive choices in the registration form is intended to make exception cases relatively rare, at least at progressive events. Most cis-gendered persons will have little reason to reject the default, as they are not harmed by gender-neutral pronouns—most of us are not even present to hear ourselves referred to in the third person.[^offended] Attendees who have gone through all that is required to change their gender presentation[^cost-to-change-genders] and prefer to have that gender acknowledged can still signal a preference for gendered pronouns. Hopefully, most will also welcome a default that bends the arc of society towards gender inclusivity, or not mind that their preference for gendered pronouns exclusively now marks them as exceptional.[^edit-out-only]

The form design also makes transparent how the information you provide to event organizers on the registration form will be shared with other attendees when you don your name tag. If you don't like anything on your name tag, you can edit it.[^name-tag-abuse] For example, if you feel obligated to register for the event with the name on your government ID, but that name does not match your identity at the event, you can change what appears on the name tag.

In designing the name tag generated by the form, I tried to make it as easy as possible for a viewer to find and read the name the wearer wants to be addressed by. The font for the name is larger than all the other information on the name tag to help those with limited vision.[^scales-down] The name is also at the top of the tag to reduce the distance one needs to look down from the wearer's face, the time required, and the awkwardness that increases the further down you need to look. Event organizers should always place event branding at the bottom of name tags, lest they signal that they value the event's brand identity above attendees' ability to know who they are talking to.

If you care about attendees being able to read each others' names, may I also suggest that you provide adjustable lanyards, so that people's name tags can be moved closer to their face, and that staff help attendees shorten the lanyards when providing them. (Attendees won't know to adjust them otherwise.) At the last event I was at, none of the name tags were visible at meals because the lanyards fell below the table height. Lastly, when using lanyards, always print name tags on both sides so that the contents are hidden when the name tag flips around.

If you are organizing an event, you are welcome to borrow as much as you like from this [open source](https://github.com/UppaJung/registration-pronouns) design. Please help us all be less bad at this.

[^offended]: This article is written for those who want to promote gender inclusivity and so I will not address the needs of those whose identities are offended by the very concept of chosen pronouns here. I have yet to encounter anyone who was 'against pronouns' whose position was not a dog whistle for being against gender inclusivity.

[^edit-out-only]: Those who prefer not to have their pronouns followed by **only** can edit it out manually.

[^name-tag-abuse]: As I work in security I am sure to have 'clever' people point out that, yes, attendees could abuse the freedom to edit the entirety of the text on their name tag to include inappropriate content or to impersonate others. Fortunately, most people will stick with the defaults and the rest can be reviewed for abuse by event staff. Reviewing the exceptions is work, but likely worthwhile work, as it can alert organizers to attendees with unanticipated needs.

[^scales-down]: Fonts automatically scale down to accommodate longer names.
