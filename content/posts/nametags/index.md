Getting people's pronouns right is a struggle when attending large events, even when those events are run and attended by people who care about gender inclusivity. When I attend events and watch others struggle with pronouns, it's both a relief that I'm not alone and a disappointment that we are *all* so bad at this.

As a human-subjects researcher, it makes sense that we're bad at it. Events make it hard. Even in 2023, most events I attend don't even have pronouns on name tags. Even if they did, the information would not be available when I needed it. If I'm talking about someone in the third-person, I'm probably not looking at them. They may not be in the same room. It's hard to keep track of the pronouns of every person I might want to talk about in conversation with others.

Attendees normally cope by continuing to default to gendered pronouns and trying to remember the *exceptions*. Unfortunately, the *exceptions* we are likely to use the wrong pronouns for are the historically-marginalized groups we're supposed to be trying to do a better job of including.

Adopting gender-neutral third-party pronouns as the norm would be more inclusive, but I've yet to attend an event that achieved this.

Changing norms requires affordances that make the new norm feel safe. If attendees fear they are more likely to offend by calling someone 'they' than guessing the correct gendered pronoun, they'll keep using gendered pronouns by default.

To make the more inclusive norm safe, we need to update event registrations and name tags to:
1. include pronouns on name tags and other materials *by default*
2. encourage attendees to welcome gender-neutral pronouns *by default*
3. allow attendees to opt out of these defaults (so nobody need object)

The following sample registration and name tag illustrate one way to do this. Try it yourself!

<link rel="stylesheet" href="./registration-form.css">
<div data-registration-form-here="true" class="registration-and-name-tag-container"></div>
<script src="./registration-pronouns.js"></script>

Note that this approach differentiates pronouns that are *preferred* from those that are simply *welcomed*. The intended norm is that most people should be okay with gender-neutral *they* pronouns (they should welcome them) even if gendered pronouns are their first choice (preferred).

The above design addresses cognitive inclusivity by making exceptions to the norm easy to spot: exceptions end with a boldface '**only**'. You can safely use 'they' pronouns for anyone who doesn't have that '**only**'. These exception cases are easier to spot and less likely to be members of marginalized populations. As you get to know other others better, you can switch to their preferred pronouns as your cognitive abilities allow.

Exception cases should also remain rare, at least at progressive events. When gender-neutral pronouns are the events' norm, cis-gendered persons should not be harmed by these pronounsâ€”most of us are not even present to hear ourselves referred to in the third person. Defaults are powerful and most will conform to well-justified norms rather than fight them.[^offended] Attendees who have gone through all that is required to change their gender presentation[^cost-to-change-genders] and prefer to have that gender acknowledged can still signal a preference for gendered pronouns. Hopefully, most will also welcome a default that bends the arc of society towards gender inclusivity.

I also designed the sample forms to provide transparency about how the information your provide to the event on the registration form will be be shared with other attendees when you don your name tag. If you don't like anything on your name tag, you can edit it.[^name-tag-abuse] For example, if you feel obligated to register with the name on your government ID, but that name does not match your identity at the event, you can change it yourself.

In designing the name tag generated by the form, I tried to make it as easy as possible for a viewer to find and read the name the wearer wants to be addressed by. The font for the name is larger than all the other information on the name tag to help those with limited vision.[^scales-down] The name is also at the top of the tag to reduce the distance one needs to look down from the wearer's face, the time required, and the awkwardness that increases the further down you need to look. (Event branding goes at the bottom of the name tag, unless you want to reveal to attendees that you value your brand above their ability to know who they're talking to.)

If you're organizing an event, you are welcome to borrow as much as you like from this [open source](https://github.com/UppaJung/registration-pronouns) design. If you've listened to me this far, may I also suggest that you provide adjustable lanyards, so that people's name tags can be moved closer to their face, and that staff help attendees shorten the lanyards at registration. (Again, defaults matter!) At the last event I was at, none of the name tags were visible at meals because the lanyards fell below the table height. Lastly, when using lanyards, always print name tags on both sides so that the contents are hidden when the name tag flips around.

[^offended]: This article is written for those who want to promote gender inclusivity and so I will not address the needs of those whose identities are offended by the very concept of chosen pronouns here. I have yet to encounter anyone who was 'against pronouns' whose position was not a dog whistle for being against gender inclusivity.

[^name-tag-abuse]: As I work in security I am sure to have 'clever' people point out that, yes, attendees could abuse the freedom to edit the entirety of the text on their name tag to include inappropriate content or to impersonate others. Fortunately, most people will stick with the defaults and the rest can be reviewed for abuse by event staff. Reviewing the exceptions is work, but likely worthwhile work, as it can alert organizers to attendees with unanticipated needs.

[^scales-down]: Fonts automatically scale down to accommodate longer names.
