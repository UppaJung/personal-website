Immorality? Inequity? Injustice?

Peer review
You must be willing to score and rank such subjective traits as “novelty” and “significance” to fulfill your scientific duty of assisting authors and evaluating the credibility of their work
You must be willing to perform peer review anonymously even if that enables toxic behavior in others
You must participate and perpetuate a system that you know to be biased in favor of the powerful.
