Dating apps require us to entrust them with our whereabouts, desires, personal photos, physical traits, age, chemical vices, beliefs, and the contents of conversations we will use to woo prospective partners. They provide safety advice to help us overcome our hesitations about sharing all this information with them.

But *making us feel safe* and *keeping us safe* and are often incompatible goals. The safety advice offered by [Tinder](https://policies.tinder.com/safety/intl/en/) [📄](dating-tips-archived-2023-08-10/tinder.jpeg), [Bumble](https://bumble.com/en-us/the-buzz/safety) [📄](dating-tips-archived-2023-08-10/bumble.jpeg), [Hinge](https://hingeapp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007194774-Safe-Dating-Advice) [📄](dating-tips-archived-2023-08-10/hinge.jpeg), [Grindr](https://help.grindr.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500009290262-Safety-tips) [📄](dating-tips-archived-2023-08-10/grindr.jpeg), [Feeld](https://support.feeld.co/hc/en-gb/articles/9406785773084-What-do-I-do-if-someone-asks-me-to-continue-the-conversation-in-a-different-app-) [📄](dating-tips-archived-2023-08-10/feeld.jpeg), and others directs your attention to the unavoidable risks of interacting prospective partners online and in person. Through omission, the advice cleverly directs your attention away from the risks introduced by the apps themselves.[^tinder-hinge-safety-tips] [^safety-tips-bumble]

**What safety tips are dating apps withholding?**

**1. It's your job to hide your profile when traveling to places you would not want it advertised.**

Since dating apps want to have as many profiles available to display at all times and locations, they are much more promiscuous in sharing our profiles than many of would want. When we travel, they share our profiles with those around us without asking us if we want in meeting people in these locations, often without notifying us that our profile is now being shared in a new locale. Their designs intentionally ignore the possibility that we might not want to advertise ourselves to those nearby during a 28-minute layover in Salt Lake City (90 minutes at LAX…maybe?).

You'll need to be especially careful to reign in their promiscuity if you are traveling somewhere you would not want your profile advertised: maybe it's not safe to be out about a certain part of your identity where you're going; maybe you're visiting friends and family who might be using the same apps but that don't yet know about aspects of your dating identity; maybe you're going someplace strictly professional; or maybe you've told admirers in the place you're visiting that you're not open to new relationships. To avoid being travel outed (or *trouted*), you will need to [disable discovery in Tinder](https://www.help.tinder.com/hc/en-us/articles/6956972185229-Delete-Your-Tinder-Account), [pause in Hinge](https://hingeapp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012595653-Can-I-temporarily-pause-my-Hinge-account-), [snooze in Bumble](https://bumble.com/en-us/the-buzz/bumble-snooze-mode), or [turn of *show me* in Feeld](https://support.feeld.co/hc/en-gb/articles/9406794134172-How-do-I-hide-my-profile-from-other-Feeld-members-). (Sadly, if Grindr has such a feature, it's not easily discoverable via a web search.)

**2. You should assume everything you share with dating apps, every action you take, and every message you send will eventually become public.**

Dating apps store everything you share with them, and everything they watch you do, in centralized databases and servers—big banks of computers in data centers. The data they store includes your profile, your likes and dislikes, and the messages you share with others. These centralized repositories store the same data for millions of users, making them ripe targets for foreign intelligence services, ransomware gangs, and other extortionists who might exploit it.

Most dating were built by scrappy startups with threadbare security teams, forbidden from slowing the rapid innovation required in a hyper-competitive market. They are ill-matched against well-resourced intelligence agencies and criminal gangs funded by nation states.[^security-priorities-at-tinder] Attackers that breach dating apps' databases will presumably work hard to avoid being detected, lest the be locked out and lose access to constant arrival of data. It's thus surprising, for example, that we know about the 2015 breach of [Ashley Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Madison_data_breach), a dating site for those seeking extramarital affairs, as the thieves could have made lots of money extorting users had they not made all the data they stole public. It stands to reason that we only know about a small minority of actual breaches. So, when you're deciding what to share data with a dating app, you should consider it optimistic to assume your data won't be seen by foreign intelligence agencies and organized crime (which sometimes work together), and eventually made public.

Sadly, it doesn't have to be this way. If dating apps recognized the possibility that their servers might be breached they could provide better advice and even do more to protect your data. But since the competition all confidently present themselves as secure, it's hard for apps to even bring up the possibility that they might not be perfectly secure. (Perhaps we should call this *toxic appulinity*.)

**3. Your dating app could expose your personal biases, even those you may not yet know you have.**

When dating apps record your actions, they often store more than just who you like and don't like, but how much time you spent looking at each part of the profile and how long it took you to make a decision.[^dating-app-records] In the wrong hands, that data could be used to quantify your explicit or implicit preferences about others' race, body shape, disability status, and other aesthetic features discernable from photos, as well as their occupation, religion, and other demographics available from the text content.[^implicit-association-test] Alas, there's not much you can do about this if you choose to use a dating app.

Were apps willing to consider the possibility that their servers might be breached, they might limit the resolution of the data they store or experiment with privacy-preserving data structures. Alas, they seem more focused on collecting and analyzing every possible morsel of data to try to find ways to make their apps more successful.

**4. Until dating apps offer secure messaging, you'll need to move to another app to reduce the risk that your conversations will become public.**

Most messaging apps offer secure (end-to-end encrypted) messaging, including iMessage, WhatsApp, Signal, Skype*, Facebook Messenger*, and others.[^e2e-optional] Dating apps do not offer secure messaging, so if their servers are breached, attackers may be able to read explicit (and mundane) word, picture, audio, and video content in your messages.


Dating apps discourage you from moving your conversations to secure messaging platforms because they say they need to eavesdrop to protect you from scams and abuse. But secure messaging does not have to be incompatible with protecting you from scams and abuse. Dating apps could provide secure messaging and give you the power to share a conversation's decryption keys when reporting abuse. They could analyze conversations for scams privately, on your device, without sending the data to a server. This wouldn't detect all scams and abuse, but it could warn of many common ones. Failing to provide secure messaging just gives scammers one more excuse to convince victims to take their conversations off app, making it harder to detect scams and abuse.

When moving a conversation to a secure messaging app, keep in mind that some, including WhatsApp or Signal, require you to share your phone number or other identifying information to connect with a conversation partner. A stalker given your phone number can often use data brokers to get your full name, address, and a slew of other information. You may want to consider a messaging app that does not require you to share your phone number (e.g., Skype[^skype]), though these are among the least popular and your matches may be less receptive to using them. (You could share this article to explain why you use them.) You may also want to consider using a service like [Kanary](https://www.kanary.com/) to understand what information data brokers store about you, and to demand that the (legally-compliant ones) remove that information, making it harder for stalkers to use your phone number to find you.

**In summary**, don't let dating apps fool you into thinking the only safety risks of using them come from interacting with other users—the risks begin the moment you first open an app and share your location.

You're own your own to protect yourself. Be safe out there.

[^tinder-hinge-safety-tips]: For example, Tinder and Hinge, which offer the the same safety tips as both are owned and operated by the Match Group.
    They divide their safety tips into three categories: 'Online Safety', which (aside from picking a password) covers the risks posed by online prospective partners; 'Meeting in Person', for when the prefix online no longer applies; and 'Sexual Health', for when the prefix 'prospective' no longer applies. The safety implications of putting your profile online and share it wherever you are notably absent.

[^safety-tips-bumble]: A notable exception is Bumble's article on [What You Need to Know About Safety on Bumble](https://bumble.com/en-us/the-buzz/safety) [Bumble](https://bumble.com/en-us/the-buzz/safety) [📄](dating-tips-archived-2023-08-10/bumble.jpeg), which does advise caution in deciding how much detail to share in one's profile:
    > We also encourage members of our community to be cautious when deciding what personal information to share in your profile. It’s absolutely fine to list your occupation as “account manager” at “tech company” rather than sharing details. Omitting photos that show you in a specific location you frequent (e.g. your go-to dog park or local bar) is another way to practice safer online dating.
    
    Still, none of their examples suggest not sharing information at all, and they do little to help users explain who will be able to access the information that the user shared or explain why sharing detailed information might be risky.

[^security-priorities-at-tinder]: Consider, for example, that Tinder, which launched in 2012, didn't even implement the rudimentary step of encrypting the photos sent to the app from its servers until [2018](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/29/17519234/tinder-encrypted-profile-photos-senator-ron-wyden) (after it was merged into the more-mature Match Group).

[^dating-app-records]: See, for example, what journalist Judith Duportail learned from requesting [the information Tinder kept](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/26/tinder-personal-data-dating-app-messages-hacked-sold) on her.

[^implicit-association-test]: For example, one could use as inputs to a prediction model the values of the above mentioned features, whether they were exposed before the user made a decision, and the amount of time they were exposed before the decision, and whether they were visible at the time of the decision.

[^e2e-optional]: Skype and Facebook Messenger offer end-to-end encryption, but users should be aware that their messaging is insecure until they manually request that the conversation be made private.

[^skype]: Skype [doesn't require a phone number](https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34942/how-are-my-contact-details-used-in-skype) but [requires extra work to turn on end-to-end encryption](https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34824/what-are-skype-private-conversations).
