Dating apps provide safety advice to help us overcome our hesitations about using them. But *making us feel safe* and *keeping us safe* and are often incompatible goals.

The safety advice offered by [Tinder](https://policies.tinder.com/safety/intl/en/) [📄](dating-tips-archived-2023-08-10/tinder.jpeg), [Bumble](https://bumble.com/en-us/the-buzz/safety) [📄](dating-tips-archived-2023-08-10/bumble.jpeg), [Hinge](https://hingeapp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007194774-Safe-Dating-Advice) [📄](dating-tips-archived-2023-08-10/hinge.jpeg), [Grindr](https://help.grindr.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500009290262-Safety-tips) [📄](dating-tips-archived-2023-08-10/grindr.jpeg), [Feeld](https://support.feeld.co/hc/en-gb/articles/9406785773084-What-do-I-do-if-someone-asks-me-to-continue-the-conversation-in-a-different-app-) [📄](dating-tips-archived-2023-08-10/feeld.jpeg), and focuses on the risks that exist whether or not you use an app.[^tinder-hinge-safety-tips] [^safety-tips-bumble] They address the risks posed by interacting with prospective partners both online and in person.

Through omission, the makers of these apps direct your attention away from the risks introduced by using an app and their app's promiscuous use of data. Dating apps require us to entrust them with our whereabouts, desires, personal photos, physical traits, age, chemical vices, beliefs, and the contents of conversations we will use to woo prospective partners. They keep detailed records of our choices and actions. Any honest discussion of dating app safety requires examining the risks posed by the dating apps themselves.

**What safety tips are dating apps not sharing?**

**1. Limit what you share in your profile and messages (it could become public)**

Dating apps store everything you share with them, the messages you share with other users, and most everything they watch you do. They store your information in centralized databases along with the data of millions of other users.[^data-stored] Storing so many people's desires, matching choices, and conversations in one repository makes it a ripe target for foreign intelligence services, ransomware gangs, and other extortionists who might exploit it.

[^data-stored]: To quote from privacy policy shared [Tinder](https://policies.tinder.com/privacy/intl/en/) and [Hinge](https://hinge.co/privacy), the data collected includes "when you logged in, features you’ve been using, actions taken, information shown to you, referring webpages address and ads that you interacted with) and your interactions with other users (e.g., users you connect and interact with, and when you matched and exchanged messages with them)."

Most dating were built by scrappy startups with threadbare security teams, forbidden from slowing the rapid innovation required in a hyper-competitive market. They are ill-matched against well-resourced intelligence agencies and nation-state sanctioned organized crime.[^security-priorities-at-tinder] Attackers that find ways to steal information from dating apps' databases will presumably work hard to avoid being detected so they can keep stealing it. It stands to reason that we only know about a small minority of actual breaches. For example, it's surprising that we actually know about the 2015 breach of [Ashley Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Madison_data_breach) (a dating service for those seeking extramarital affairs) as the thieves who stole it gave up the lucrative opportunity to extort the service's users when they made the stolen data public. Every use profile and every message was released for the world to read.

When you're deciding what data to share with a dating app, you should do so knowing that it's a distinct possibility that everything you share, and every message you send other users via the app, will eventually be made public.

<!-- Sadly, it doesn't have to be this way. If dating apps recognized the possibility that their servers might be breached they could provide better advice and even do more to protect your data. But since the competition all confidently present themselves as secure, it's hard for apps to even bring up the possibility that they might not be perfectly secure. (Perhaps we should call this *toxic appulinity*.) -->

**2. Move conversations to secure messaging platforms for more privacy**

The best way to protect the privacy of your conversations is to move them to a secure messaging app.

You wouldn't need to do this if dating apps prioritized your safety and implemented secure (end-to-end encrypted) messaging. Secure (end-to-end encrypted) messaging is now industry standard for messaging apps, available in iMessage, WhatsApp, Signal, Skype*, Facebook Messenger*, and others.[^e2e-optional] The lack of secure messaging discredits dating app's claims that they "design all of our products and services with your privacy in mind" ([Hinge](https://hinge.co/privacy) and [Tinder](https://policies.tinder.com/privacy/intl/en/) from the Match Group) and that "making sure that our community is safe…is our highest priority" ([Bumble](https://bumble.com/en-us/the-buzz/safety)). They discourage users from moving conversations to messaging apps, purportedly so that they can better prevent abuse,[^preventing-abuse] though some apps also want to examine your messages for such purposes as identifying "topics, sentiments, and trends".[^bumble-trends]

[^preventing-abuse]: Dating apps discourage you from moving conversations to secure messaging apps, claiming that eavesdropping helps them protect you from scams and abuse. There's a touch of truth to this, but dating apps could provide secure messaging and still give you the power to share a conversation's decryption keys when reporting abuse. They could analyze conversations for scams privately, on your device, to warn you about them without sending the data to a server.

Until dating apps offer secure messaging, your only option to prevent them from eavesdropping on your conversations is to take those conversations elsewhere. This is a delicate dance, because scammers want you to move off-app quickly so that dating apps can't see what they're up to. So, you and your match will need to do your best to convince each other that you are not scammers without giving out information you wouldn't want to become public.

Further complicating the decision to move off-app is that doing so may make you more easy to identify by your match. Many secure messaging apps like Signal and WhatsApp currently require you to share your phone number or other information to start a conversation with someone. You may not yet be ready for a match to be able to call you, text you, or try to learn more about you.[^anti-data-brokers] A web search on your phone number will likely lead stalkers to data brokers willing to sell them your full name, address, and other personal information. Secure messengers built into social media apps (e.g. Facebook Messenger) require you to share your social media identity, which comes with its own risks. Skype offers secure messaging (though you'll have to turn it on for each conversation) and identifies you by email address. You will probably want to create an email address you use exclusively for dating so that you can use secure messengers like Skype[^skype]. Alas, your matches may have long abandoned the likes of Skype and other messengers that don't identify you by phone number. (If they're skeptical of trying them, consider sharing this article!)

[^anti-data-brokers]: To further protect yourself from being stalked by your phone number, you should also consider using a service like [Kanary](https://www.kanary.com/) to find out what information data brokers know about you and demand that they stop selling it.

**3. It is *your* job to hide your profile in places you would not want it advertised.**

Since dating apps want to have as many profiles available to display at all times and locations, they are much more promiscuous in sharing your profiles than you may want. When you travel, many will share your profiles with those around you without asking you if you want to meet people in these locations. They may not even make you aware that your profile is now being shared in a new locale. Their designs intentionally ignore the possibility that you might not want to advertise yourself to other users who happen to be close by during a 28-minute layover in Salt Lake City. (90 minutes at LAX…maybe?)

You'll need to be especially careful to reign in their promiscuous sharing of your profile if you are traveling somewhere you would not want your profile advertised: maybe it's not safe to be out about a certain part of your identity where you're going; maybe you're visiting friends and family who you are not yet out to (and who might use the same app); maybe you're going someplace strictly professionally; or maybe you've told admirers that you're visiting that you're not open to new relationships and don't want them to be wiser. To avoid being travel outed (or *trouted*), you will need to [disable discovery in Tinder](https://www.help.tinder.com/hc/en-us/articles/6956972185229-Delete-Your-Tinder-Account), [pause in Hinge](https://hingeapp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012595653-Can-I-temporarily-pause-my-Hinge-account-), [snooze in Bumble](https://bumble.com/en-us/the-buzz/bumble-snooze-mode), or [turn of *show me* in Feeld](https://support.feeld.co/hc/en-gb/articles/9406794134172-How-do-I-hide-my-profile-from-other-Feeld-members-). (Sadly, if Grindr has such a feature, it's not easily discoverable via a web search.)

Still, hiding your profile can't ensure it remains private. Anyone who sees your profile could, for example, copy and paste it to social media. Data brokers have harvested dating profiles ([as documented by TacticalTech](https://datadating.tacticaltech.org/viz)). As someone with the patience to read to page 14 of [Bumble's 19-page privacy policy](BumblePrivacyPolicy.pdf) might learn, "you should assume that **anything** you post or submit on the App may be publicly-viewable and accessible."


**4. Using a dating app could expose personal biases even you don't know you have.**

When dating apps record your actions, they often store more than just who you like and don't like, but also how much time you spent looking at each part of the profile and how long it took you to make a decision.[^dating-app-records] That data could reveal your explicit or implicit preferences about others' race, body shape, disability status, and other aesthetic features discernible from photos, as well as their occupation, religion, and other demographics available from the text content.[^implicit-association-test] Alas, there's no guaranteed way to ensure your behaviors don't exhibit such biases. The only way to keep you safe is for apps to collect less data about your choices and keep the information they do collect for less time. Unless forced by public pressure or regulation to collect and store data less promiscuously, they'll continue to collect and store every morsel of data they can.

**In summary**, the safety risks of app-based dating include risks introduced by the apps themselves from the moment you open the app and share your location. These risks are made worse because the choices that are truly best for your safety are not best for the apps. Since they don't like to discuss these safety risks, you're on your own to protect yourself. Be safe out there.

[^tinder-hinge-safety-tips]: For example, Tinder and Hinge, which offer the same safety tips as both are owned and operated by the Match Group.
    They divide their safety tips into three categories: 'Online Safety', which (aside from picking a password) covers the risks posed by online prospective partners; 'Meeting in Person', for when the prefix online no longer applies; and 'Sexual Health', for when the prefix 'prospective' no longer applies. The safety implications of putting your profile online and sharing it wherever you are is notably absent.

[^safety-tips-bumble]: A notable exception is Bumble's article on [What You Need to Know About Safety on Bumble](https://bumble.com/en-us/the-buzz/safety) [📄](dating-tips-archived-2023-08-10/bumble.jpeg), which does advise caution in deciding how much detail to share in one's profile:
    > We also encourage members of our community to be cautious when deciding what personal information to share in your profile. It’s absolutely fine to list your occupation as “account manager” at “tech company” rather than sharing details. Omitting photos that show you in a specific location you frequent (e.g. your go-to dog park or local bar) is another way to practice safer online dating.
    
    Still, none of their examples suggest not sharing information at all, and they do little to help users explain who will be able to access the information that the user shared or explain why sharing detailed information might be risky.

[^security-priorities-at-tinder]: Consider, for example, that Tinder, which launched in 2012, didn't even implement the rudimentary step of encrypting the photos sent to the app from its servers until [2018](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/29/17519234/tinder-encrypted-profile-photos-senator-ron-wyden) (after it was merged into the more-mature Match Group).

[^dating-app-records]: See, for example, what journalist Judith Duportail learned from requesting [the information Tinder kept](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/26/tinder-personal-data-dating-app-messages-hacked-sold) on her.

[^implicit-association-test]: For example, one could use as inputs to a prediction model the values of the above mentioned features, whether they were exposed before the user made a decision, and the amount of time they were exposed before the decision, and whether they were visible at the time of the decision.

[^e2e-optional]: Skype and Facebook Messenger offer end-to-end encryption, but users should be aware that their messaging is insecure until they manually request that the conversation be made private.

[^bumble-trends]: Bumble's privacy policy reveals they also read your messages to "identify topics, sentiments, and trends across our Users" though, of course, safety is their "highest priority".

[^skype]: Skype [doesn't require a phone number](https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34942/how-are-my-contact-details-used-in-skype) but [requires extra work to turn on end-to-end encryption](https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34824/what-are-skype-private-conversations). You'll want to make sure you create an account that is not linked to an email address that identifies you.
