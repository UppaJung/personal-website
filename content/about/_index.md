I'm a scientist who critiques scientific culture, a security technologist who debunks security technologies, and a human-subjects researcher who isn't the best people person. This doesn't make me very popular… 

…at least until people learn that my research debunking common security practices is part of the reason why they no longer have to answer so many 'security' questions[^jesus], why their employer no longer asks them to reset their password every 90 days, and why many websites no longer care if your password has digits, punctuation, or uppercase letters.

I'm currently an `'Associate\0'` at Harvard's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences[^null-terminal] and also work on [DiceKeys](https://dicekeys.com). I was formerly at Microsoft Research and MIT Lincoln Laboratory.

[^jesus]: if you have but chance to guess a US account's *favorite historical person*, the [data](http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/79594/oakland09.pdf) suggest you put your faith in 'jesus'.


[^null-terminal]: The `\0` is not a typo, but geek (c language notation) for "there's nothing missing after the word 'Associate'". I'm not a Professor.
